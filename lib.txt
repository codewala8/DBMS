Write a database trigger on Library table. The System should keep track of the records that 
are being updated or deleted. The old value of updated or deleted records should be added 
in Library_Audit table. 

create database lib;
use lib;

CREATE TABLE Library (
    book_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    title VARCHAR(20),
    author VARCHAR(25)
);

CREATE TABLE Library_Audit (
    audit_id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
    book_id INT,
    title VARCHAR(20),
    author VARCHAR(25),
    action_type VARCHAR(10)
);

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER trg_library_audit
AFTER UPDATE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Library_Audit (book_id, title, author, action_type)
    VALUES (OLD.book_id, OLD.title, OLD.author, 'UPDATE');
END;
//

DELIMITER //
CREATE TRIGGER trg_library_delete_audit
AFTER DELETE ON Library
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    INSERT INTO Library_Audit (book_id, title, author, action_type)
    VALUES (OLD.book_id, OLD.title, OLD.author, 'DELETE');
END;
//
DELIMITER ;


INSERT INTO Library (book_id, title, author) VALUES (1, '1984', 'ABC');
INSERT INTO Library (book_id, title, author) VALUES (2, 'DBMS', 'PQR');


UPDATE Library SET title = 'CNS' WHERE book_id = 1;

DELETE FROM Library WHERE book_id = 2;


SELECT * FROM Library_Audit;
SELECT * FROM Library;
